<p>I just created another <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/142017">pull request</a> to get <a href="https://github.com/gtk2hs/svgcairo/">svgcairo</a> building on <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/haskell-updates">haskell-updates</a> again. My original goal of getting <a href="http://felsin9.de/nnis/ghc-vis">ghc-vis</a> to work still lays ahead, I also <em>still</em> plan to write about the whole process <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/posts/2021-10-11-ghc-vis.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Oh and I put myself down as the maintainer of <code>svgcairo</code> so I guess I’ll try to help keep the package happy <del>if</del> when it breaks.</p>

<p>I received my first soldering station earlier in the week, I decided on a <a href="https://www.hakko.com/english/products/hakko_fx888d_tips.html">Hakko FX-888D</a> and so far very happy with the purchase. However I’m having a hard time working with lead-free solder so might try 60/40 while getting used to everything.</p>

<p>I finished <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54120408-klara-and-the-sun">Klara and the Sun</a> with the book club. I generally enjoyed it, worldbuilding was exceptional; but similar to how I felt with the author’s other book we read, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28920.A_Pale_View_of_Hills">A Pale View of Hills</a>, there were lots loose ends by the end. Our next book is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38357895-convenience-store-woman">Convenience Store Woman</a>.</p>
