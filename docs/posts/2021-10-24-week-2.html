<p>A couple of things going on here this week:</p>
<h4 id="nixpkgs">nixpkgs</h4>
<h5 id="ghc-vis">ghc-vis</h5>
<ul>
<li>I decided I shouldn’t spend any more time trying to completely bootstrap <code>ghc-vis</code> because it’s obviously a tricky situation, just disabling library profiling was fixing the build so I created a <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/142425">PR</a> doing that. I also asked for suggestions and got some good ones so I’ll try to get back to this sometime soon.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="svgcairo">svgcairo</h5>
<ul>
<li>It turned out the fix I patched <code>svgcairo</code> with wasn’t working on darwin so got pinged about that. Apparently the patch deleted a flag from <code>cpp-options</code> that was needed on darwin so <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/142492">added it back with a conditional</a>, also got asked to upstream the changes so I did that along with the fix bumping the lower bound on <code>librsvg</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="eventlog2html">eventlog2html</h5>
<ul>
<li>I <em>finally</em> got to use eventlog2html at work on Friday, realizing the package was broken on darwin I thought I’d see what’s wrong but it seemed to work just fine. I also tried on my PC once I got off work and nothing jumped out at me so I created a <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/142590">PR</a> unmarking the package as broken.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h4>
<h5 id="hs-nix-template">hs-nix-template</h5>
<ul>
<li>I fixed a Github actions issue <a href="https://github.com/utdemir/hs-nix-template/pull/26">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="type-errors-pretty">type-errors-pretty</h5>
<ul>
<li>I got back to this tiny feature request on <a href="https://github.com/kowainik/type-errors-pretty/pull/22">type-errors-pretty</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like I said the last time I had problems with the solder I had so I got a new one which seemed to help. I got two new chisel tips as well, one sized 1.2mm and the other 2.4mm; and they work great! Now that I got all my gear ready I’m hoping I’ll be starting a keyboard build pretty soon.</p>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>We’re done with <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38357895-convenience-store-woman">Convenience Store Woman</a>. This was also pretty good, it starts as one thing and towards the middle takes a turn. It could also work just as this cutesy story about a woman working at a convenience store but how the book evolved towards the end makes this a memorable read.</p>
<p>Our next book is: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51287.Incompleteness">Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Gödel</a></p>
