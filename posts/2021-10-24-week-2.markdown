## OSS
A couple of things going on here this week:

#### nixpkgs

##### ghc-vis
- I decided I shouldn't spend any more time trying to completely bootstrap 
`ghc-vis` because it's obviously a tricky situation, just disabling library
profiling was fixing the build so I created a 
[PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/142425) doing that. I also asked
for suggestions and got some good ones so I'll try to get back to this 
sometime soon.

##### svgcairo
- It turned out the fix I patched `svgcairo` with wasn't working on darwin so
got pinged about that. Apparently the patch deleted a flag from `cpp-options`
that was needed on darwin so
[added it back with a conditional](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/142492), 
also got asked to upstream the changes so I did that along with the fix bumping 
the lower bound on `librsvg`.

##### eventlog2html
- I _finally_ got to use eventlog2html at work on Friday, realizing the 
package was broken on darwin I thought I'd see what's wrong but it seemed to 
work just fine. I also tried on my PC once I got off work and nothing jumped 
out at me so I created a [PR](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/142590) 
unmarking the package as broken.

#### Miscellaneous

##### hs-nix-template
- I fixed a Github actions issue [here](https://github.com/utdemir/hs-nix-template/pull/26).

##### type-errors-pretty
- I got back to this tiny feature request on [type-errors-pretty](https://github.com/kowainik/type-errors-pretty/pull/22).

## Hobbies
Like I said the last time I had problems with the solder I had so I got a new one which seemed to help.
I got two new chisel tips as well, one sized 1.2mm and the other 2.4mm; and they work great! Now that 
I got all my gear ready I'm hoping I'll be starting a keyboard build pretty soon.

## Books
We're done with [Convenience Store Woman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38357895-convenience-store-woman). 
This was also pretty good, it starts as one thing and towards the middle takes a turn. It could also work just
as this cutesy story about a woman working at a convenience store but how the book evolved towards the end makes
this a memorable read.

Our next book is: [Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt GÃ¶del](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51287.Incompleteness)
