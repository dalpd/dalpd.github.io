title: "Weeknotes: 001"
---

I originally planned to start this last week but forgot so discarded what I have from before. I'll probably post these on Sundays but might also try others and see what sticks. I'm not really sure about the format either but I think I'll just do this under random headings for now.

## OSS
I'm starting with this as I just created another [pull request](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/142017) to get [svgcairo](https://github.com/gtk2hs/svgcairo/) building on [haskell-updates](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/haskell-updates) again. My original goal of getting [ghc-vis](http://felsin9.de/nnis/ghc-vis) to work still lays ahead, I also _still_ plan to write about the whole process [here](http://127.0.0.1:8000/posts/2021-10-11-ghc-vis.html) as I think it could be helpful for folks wanting to get a start in all things nix. 

Oh and I put myself down as the maintainer of `svgcairo` so I guess I'll try to help keep the package happy on nixpkgs.

## Hobbies
I received my first soldering station earlier in the week, I decided on a [Hakko FX-888D](https://www.hakko.com/english/products/hakko_fx888d_tips.html) and so far very happy with the purchase. However I'm having a hard time working with lead-free solder so might try 60/40 while getting used to everything.

## Social
I was able to eat out for the first time since the pandemic started, thanks YiÄŸit!

## Books
I finished [Klara and the Sun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54120408-klara-and-the-sun) with our book club of two. I generally enjoyed it, worldbuilding was exceptional; but similar to how I felt with his other book we read: [A Pale View of Hills](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28920.A_Pale_View_of_Hills) I thought there were a lot of loose ends by the end.
Our next book is [Convenience Store Woman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38357895-convenience-store-woman).
