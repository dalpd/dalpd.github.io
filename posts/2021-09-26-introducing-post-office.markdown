title: Introducing "Post Office"
---

Hi!

I'm Deniz Alp, you might know me from Twitter as [\@lambdazai](https://twitter.com/lambdazai); lately I've been feeling like I'm not really enjoying the bird site __:TM:__ as much as I used to, therefore I'll try to post on this shiny new *thing* for a while.

This weekend I was planning get a couple of things done, in no particular order:

* get [\`ghc-vis\`](http://felsin9.de/nnis/ghc-vis/) working on nixpkgs, more on this [on a future post](./2021-09-26-ghc-vis.html).
* get my old printer to work, more on this [on a future sub-post](./../sub-posts/2021-09-26-printer.html).
* <details>
    <summary>decide on what soldering station to get.</summary>
    <span>
      <br> **\*extremely Fredo voice\*** I'm going to learn the tiny keyboard business.
      <br>
    </span>
    <br>
  </details>

I'm writing this as the weekend is coming to a close and I haven't really been able to cross any of those off my list...

Getting into the habit of writing just for its own sake has been something I've wanted to do for a long time so I'm hoping I'll be able to keep this going with weeknotes I'll post here.
